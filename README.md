# 3D Portfolio Starter Next.js + React Three Fiber

Loads a GLB if you drop one into `public/models/room.glb`, and includes a resume modal.

## Quickstart
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Replace with your assets
- Put your room model at `public/models/room.glb` (glTF/GLB). Recommended: Draco compression.
- Put your resume at `public/resume.pdf` and update the link text in `app/page.jsx` if you want.

## Deploy
- Push to GitHub, then connect the repo to Vercel. No config needed.
- Add a custom domain in Vercel's dashboard when you're ready.
